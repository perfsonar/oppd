# SSL configuration options
#
###############################################################################

#
# ssl - SSL (Secure Socket Layer) support.
#
# Enable or disable SSL (Secure Socket Layer) support, which means that
# the daemon will expect HTTPS requests instead of normal HTTP request.
# IMPORTANT: Normal HTTP requests will not work anymore if SSL is enabled!
# IMPORTANT: Most of the following options are necessary for SSL. You should
#            take care of all of them and make sure that you really know what
#            you are doing! If oppd is missing a necessary option, you will get
#            an error message and the daemon will not start!
#
# Valid options: yes, on, 1, true, no, off, 0, false
#
# Default: off
#
# Example:
# ssl            on
#
#ssl            off


#
# ssl_cert_file - SSL certificate file.
#
# Use this option to specify the location of your certificate.
# This option is required and there is NO default value!
#
# Valid options: File path (file format should be PEM)
#
# Default: none
#
# Example:
# ssl_cert_file  /var/www/certs/server-cert.pem
#
#ssl_cert_file  [FILL ME]

#
# Example:
# ssl_key_file   /var/www/certs/server-key.pem
#
#ssl_key_file   [FILL ME]


#
# ssl_verify_client - Verify SSL client certificate.
#
# Enable or Disable the verification of the SSL client certificate. This is
# normally used as a method of client authentication.
# IMPORTANT: This option is enabled by default, because you normally don't want
#            to allow access to perfSONAR services by untrusted users. You
#            should only disable it if you really know what you are doing!
#
# Valid options: yes, on, 1, true, no, off, 0, false
#
# Default: on
#
# Example:
# ssl_verify_client  off
#
#ssl_verify_client  on


#
# ssl_ca_file - SSL certificate(s) of the reputable certificate authorities.
#
# If you want to verify that the peer certificate has been signed by a
# reputable certificate authority (see ssl_verify_client above), then you
# must use this option (and/or ssl_ca_path below) to locate the file
# containing the certificate(s) of the reputable certificate authorities.
# There is NO default value!
#
# Valid options: File path (file format should be PEM)
#
# Default: none
#
# Example:
# ssl_ca_file    /var/www/certs/my-ca.pem
#
#ssl_ca_file    [FILL ME]


#
# ssl_ca_path - Directory containing SSL certificate(s)
#
# If you want to verify that the peer certificate has been signed by a
# reputable certificate authority (see ssl_verify_client above), then you
# must use this option (and/or ssl_ca_file above) to locate the certificate(s)
# of the reputable certificate authorities.
# If you are unusually friendly with the OpenSSL documentation, you might have
# set yourself up a directory containing several trusted certificates as
# separate files as well as an index of the certificates.
# Use this option to specify the location of this directory.
# There is NO default value!
#
# Valid options: Directory path
#
# Default: none
#
# Example:
# ssl_ca_path    /var/www/certs/ca/
#
#ssl_ca_path    [FILL ME]

# Configuring services

###############################################################################
#
# You have to define (at least) one or more <service> sections for every

# in this file, it is most likely more comfortable to use the following
# statement to include all files in the subdirectory oppd-server.d ending with suffix
